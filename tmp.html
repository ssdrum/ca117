          <p>
            We are five young, self driven students with a shared goal of
            helping to save our planet. Our aim is to encourage you to invest in
            not just our product but our planet, your childrens planet, your
            family's planet and your pets planet. Buy your Eco-Charger today and
            reduce carbon emissions, save money on electricity plus fuel and get
            active along the way!

          <h2 class="title">What is the Eco Charger?</h2>
          <p>
            The Eco-charge is a eco- friendly phone charger. The charger works
            through kinetic energy created by the wheels of your bike as you
            cycle. This means by cycling you create a free renewable energy
            which in turn charges up your phone. The charger is compatible with
            any smartphone brand using a USB connector. There are also two
            charging ports meaning that it is possible to charge two devices at
            the same time. Our product along with its app gives cyclists the
            freedom to spend hours travelling, let that be to work, school or
            simply on a joy ride with no worries whatsoever of their phone
            running out of battery.
